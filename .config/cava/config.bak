[general]

# Accepts only non-negative values.
; framerate = 60

# 'autosens' will attempt to decrease sensitivity if the bars peak. 1 = on, 0 = off
# new as of 0.6.0 autosens of low values (dynamic range)
# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of terminal height) without initiating autosens. DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0
; autosens = 1
; overshoot = 20

# Manual sensitivity in %. If autosens is enabled, this will only be the initial value.
# 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
; sensitivity = 100

# The number of bars (0-200). 0 sets it to auto (fill up console).
# Bars' width and space between bars in number of characters.

# For SDL width and space between bars is in pixels, defaults are:
; bar_width = 20
; bar_spacing = 5


# Lower and higher cutoff frequencies for lowest and highest bars
# the bandwidth of the visualizer.
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwidth of 43Mhz x number of bars.
# Cava will automatically increase the higher cutoff if a too low band is specified.
; lower_cutoff_freq = 50
; higher_cutoff_freq = 10000


# Seconds with no input before cava goes to sleep mode. Cava will not perform FFT or drawing and
# only check for input once per second. Cava will wake up once input is detected. 0 = disable.
; sleep_timer = 0

[output]

# enable alacritty synchronized updates. 1 = on, 0 = off
# removes flickering in alacritty terminal emeulator.
# defaults to off since the behaviour in other terminal emulators is unknown

[color]

; background = default

[smoothing]

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable.
;monstercat = 1
;waves = 1 

# Noise reduction, float 0 - 1. default 0.77
# the raw visualization is very noisy, this factor adjusts the integral and gravity filters to keep the signal smooth
# 1 will be very slow and smooth, 0 will be fast but noisy.
